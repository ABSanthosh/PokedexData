    "0002": "There is a bud on this Pokemon's back. To support its weight, Ivysaur's legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it starts spending more time lying in the sunlight, it's a sign that the bud will bloom into a large flower soon.",

    "0021": "Due to its short wings, it can't fly long distances. It wanders about restlessly and pecks at bug Pokemon.",
    "0022": "In Alola, fish Pokemon are its prey. It can be seen circling above the ocean searching for food.",

    "0024": "After stunning its opponents with the pattern on its stomach, it quickly wraps them up in its body and waits for them to stop moving.",

    "0026": "Because so many Trainers like the way Pikachu looks, you don't see this Pokemon very often.",

    "0035": "Bathed in moonlight, its wings glow faintly. Without even flapping, Clefairy rises into the air, where it dances around.",
    "0036": "Some scientists believe that it gazes intently at the sky on nights with a full moon because it's homesick.",
    "0037": "It manipulates balls of fire to catch its prey. If you raise one from when it's young, it will grow close to you like a puppy Pokemon.",
    "0038": "The flickering flames it spews from its mouth leave its opponents hypnotized. Then, this extremely intelligent Pokemon attacks.",
    "0039": "The songs they sing are totally different depending on the region they live in. Some even sound like they're shouting!",

    "0052": "It loves coins, so if you give it one, you can make friends with Meowth easily. But it's fickle, so you can't count on that friendship lasting.",
    "0053": "This Pokemon is popular with rich people. It's also targeted by hunters who are after the jewel in its forehead.",
    "0054": "It has been found that its brain cells are 10 times more active when Psyduck is experiencing a headache.",
    "0055": "A professional swimmer, it can continue swimming for two days straight by waving its long tail skillfully.",

    "0058": "It has lived alongside humans since ages ago. Its bones have been found in excavations of ruins from the Stone Age.",
    "0059": "There are so many old tales about them that they're called legendary Pokemon, but there are way more of them around than you'd expect.",
    "0060": "The direction of the swirl on their stomachs differs depending on where they live. Poliwag aficionados can tell them apart at a glance.",
    "0061": "Its health suffers when its skin dries out, so be sure to moisturize it diligently.",
    "0062": "The muscles it has developed through swimming are thick and powerful. When it lands a square punch, it can turn huge boulders to dust.",

    "0064": "It possesses strong mental capabilities, but its psychic powers are halved when it's not holding a silver spoon.",

    "0087": "It sunbathes on the beach after meals. The rise in its body temperature helps its digestion.",
    "0088": "The wastewater coming from factories is clean these days, so Grimer have nothing to eat. They're said to be on the verge of extinction.",
    "0089": "Because they scatter germs everywhere, they've long been targeted for extermination, leading to a steep decline in their population.",
    "0090": "Even when its shell is closed, its tongue still hangs out. If you give its tongue a good yank, the shock will cause Shellder to open its shell.",
    "0091": "Slowpoke tails are its favorite food. It has even been known to come up on land to look for Slowpoke from time to time.",

    "0109": "Koffing embodies toxic substances. It mixes the toxins with raw garbage to set off a chemical reaction that results in a terribly powerful poison gas. The higher the temperature, the more gas is concocted by this Pokemon.",

    "0111": "Rhyhorn's brain is very small. It is so dense, while on a run it forgets why it started running in the first place. It apparently remembers sometimes if it demolishes something.",
    "0112": "Rhydon has a horn that serves as a drill. It is used for destroying rocks and boulders. This Pokemon occasionally rams into streams of magma, but the armor-like hide prevents it from feeling the heat.",
    "0113": "Because the eggs on their bellies have been overharvested by people in the past, the Chansey population remains very small.",

    "0814": "It kicks berries right off the branches of trees and then juggles them with its feet, practicing its footwork.",

    "0864": "Be cautious of the ectoplasmic body surrounding its soul. You'll become stiff as stone if you touch it.",

    "0880": "The powerful muscles in its tail generate its electricity. Compared to its lower body, its upper half is entirely too small.",
    "0881": "This Pokemon lived on prehistoric seashores and was able to preserve food with the ice on its body. It went extinct because it moved so slowly.",
    "0882": "Its mighty legs are capable of running at speeds exceeding 40 mph, but this Pokemon can't breathe unless it's underwater.",
    "0883": "The skin on its face is impervious to attack, but breathing difficulties made this Pokemon go extinct anyway.",
